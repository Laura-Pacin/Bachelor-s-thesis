## Abstract

This thesis analyzes the presence and implications of ethnic discrimination in Colombia’s rural labor market, using microdata from the 2014 Colombian Agricultural Census. Logit models are estimated to examine whether producers prefer hiring workers of their own ethnicity, controlling for education and age.

The results show systematic evidence of **taste-based discrimination**: across the country, producers are significantly more likely to hire workers from their own ethnic group. This matching pattern is robust across departments and persists across all education levels. In many cases, this leads to **labor misallocation**, as lower-skilled workers from the producer’s ethnic group are favored over better-educated workers from other groups.

The thesis also explores how these dynamics vary by department, and interacts with gender, showing that discriminatory hiring practices can reinforce low human capital accumulation and further marginalize historically disadvantaged groups.
